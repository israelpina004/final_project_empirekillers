##### By Steven Rakhmanchik and Israel Pina

## How to run
###(cause lets be honest that's all most of you care about)

## "What did you guys make?"

We have replicated the SHA-512 encryption algorithm through a Python program. It is run through the terminal.

### "How can I check if this works?"

(To be expanded upon once our program is complete.)

### "How does it work?"

See our [PRESENTATION.md file](https://github.com/israelpina004/final_project_empirekillers/blob/master/PRESENTATION.md).

## "What's the homework?"

You can find our homework assignment in the [HOMEWORK.md file](https://github.com/israelpina004/final_project_empirekillers/blob/master/HOMEWORK.md).
