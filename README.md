## "What'd you guys make?"

Our project demonstrates the capabilities of Powershell Empire, how it works, and how you can use it.

## What is Powershell Empire?

Powershell Empire is a tool that helps create payloads in order to gain access to systems.

### "Wait, what?"

Powershell Empire is essentially a hacking tool. It allows one to create customized payload files to help gain access to someone else's computer once the user [victim] opens said file on their machine. 

### "What's a payload?"

A payload is a file that contains malicious code used to establish a backdoor into the victim's system and often to also establish persistence on said system. They often go undetected because they run in the background of the victim's system.

### "Wow, really? How do I do this?"

See our PRESENTATION.md file. (We do not encourage any illegal activity!)

### "Tell me more!"

Much more can be learned on our PRESENTATION.md file.

### "So who did most of the work?"

We can assure you the workload was evenly distributed. See our WORKLOG.md file.

### "Oh, okay. I'll be sure to check them out."

Awesome.
