# SHA Encryption
##### By Steven Rakhmanchik and Israel Pina

## How to run
*(cause lets be honest that's all most of you care about)*

### Usage:
```
$ python3 sha.py [bits] [message]            
```
**Bits can be:**     *224, 256, 384, 512*
**Message can be:**  *anything*

### Example:
```
$ python3 sha.py 256 Special Military Operation            
  
  997c544f1be0a2dde15ce4e764321511ce9abdb34c7e7c661439e0382191a396
```

**We can check by using this website, which gives us the same result:** *https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha512.html*


## "What did you guys make?"

We have replicated the SHA-512 encryption algorithm through a Python program. It is run through the terminal.

### "How can I check if this works?"

(To be expanded upon once our program is complete.)

### "How does it work?"

See our [PRESENTATION.md file](https://github.com/israelpina004/final_project_empirekillers/blob/master/PRESENTATION.md).

## "What's the homework?"

You can find our homework assignment in the [HOMEWORK.md file](https://github.com/israelpina004/final_project_empirekillers/blob/master/HOMEWORK.md).
