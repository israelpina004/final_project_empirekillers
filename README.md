# SHA-512 Encryption
##### By Steven Rakhmanchik and Israel Pina

## How to run
*(cause lets be honest that's all most of you care about)*

### Usage:
```
$ python3 sha.py [bits] [message]            
  
  9b71d224bd62f3785d96d46ad3ea3d73319bfbc2890caadae2dff72519673ca72323c3d99ba5c11d7c7acc6e14b8c5da0c4663475c2e5c3adef46f73bcdec043
```
**Bits can be:**     *224, 256, 384, 512*
**Message can be:**  *anything*

### Example:
```
$ python3 sha.py 512 hello world            
  
  9b71d224bd62f3785d96d46ad3ea3d73319bfbc2890caadae2dff72519673ca72323c3d99ba5c11d7c7acc6e14b8c5da0c4663475c2e5c3adef46f73bcdec043
```

## "What did you guys make?"

We have replicated the SHA-512 encryption algorithm through a Python program. It is run through the terminal.

### "How can I check if this works?"

(To be expanded upon once our program is complete.)

### "How does it work?"

See our [PRESENTATION.md file](https://github.com/israelpina004/final_project_empirekillers/blob/master/PRESENTATION.md).

## "What's the homework?"

You can find our homework assignment in the [HOMEWORK.md file](https://github.com/israelpina004/final_project_empirekillers/blob/master/HOMEWORK.md).
