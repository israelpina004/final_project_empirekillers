# SHA-512 Encryption
##### By Steven Rakhmanchik and Israel Pina

## "What did you guys make?"

We have replicated the SHA-512 encryption algorithm through Python.

### "What's SHA-512?"

SHA-512 is a hashing algorithm used to convert text into another string of text of a fixed length. Each SHA-512 string is 512 bits,
or 64 bytes, long. It is used in email address hashing, password hashing, and blockchain projects, among other things.

### "How can I check if this works?"

(To be expanded upon once our program is complete.)
